# Introduction 



SensorWireless is an remote temperature sensor and rele actuator. The
communication is performed thought a BLE device, the temperature
sensor is DALLAS family and compatible Rele device.


The project is based on the arduino nano architecture. The board uses
a Atmega 320P. 

The mainly functionalities of the firmware are described bellow:

- Keeping in memory the last N minutes of temperature.
- Switch on/off the Rele.
- Getting the avg temperature of last N seconds.
